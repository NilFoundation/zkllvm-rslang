   = note: this error originates in the macro `syscall` which comes from the expansion of the attribute macro `tokio::main` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)

note: some details are omitted, run with `MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-backtrace=full` for a verbose backtrace

error: aborting due to previous error
